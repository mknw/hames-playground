Side failures are now visible instead of silent (#420).

- **New `warning` event** (`WarningEventData`, `WarningTask`): a side task — the conversation title, the post-turn result summaries, `compactIntent`'s rewrite, the retriever's query rewrite, `withReferences`' selection — failed and the turn ran on a fallback. It is always committed, rendered metadata-only into LLM-facing serializations, and is never read by `settleTurn`, `runChain`'s stop rule or `EventView.hasErrors()`, so a side failure cannot fail a turn or make the synthesizer apologise. `compactIntent`, the retriever's rewrite and `withReferences`' selector emit it where they used to emit an `error` (the selector's carried `kind: 'llm_call'`; the call record now rides the warning). **Breaking for exhaustive consumers**: `EventType` gains `'warning'`, so a `Record<EventType, …>` or an exhaustive `switch` over it stops compiling until it handles the new member.
- **`withReferences`**: a selector that throws no longer skips the wrapped pattern; it runs with nothing attached, as `DEFAULT_ERROR_SEVERITY` already described.
- **`compactBulkData`**: a batch that throws falls back per item (it used to skip the fallback), and a describe failure that leaves a result unsummarized records one `warning` per turn. **Breaking for describe implementations that relied on it**: the `DescribeFn` / `DescribeBatchFn` seam now treats a throw as the failure signal. `describeToolResultOp` and `describeToolResultsBatchOp` (`@hames-ai/harness-baml`) now **throw** on a failed call instead of returning `''` / an empty map.
- **`runFirstTurnTitleGen`** (`@hames-ai/agents`) now **rejects** when the generation failed, instead of returning the same `null` as "nothing to name". `runRegenerateTitle` keeps its null-on-failure contract. `warningBubble` joins `errorBubble` in `replay`.
- **Data Stash**: a failed ingest records its reason on the document as `ingestError` (cleared by the next run), and `IngestStatus` gains `'not_indexed'` for a copy stored in a format with no text to index. **Breaking for `GraphStashBridge` hosts** (`@hames-ai/connectors`): `ingest()` now resolves with how the run ended (`GraphStashIngestOutcome`), and `graph_file_ingest` waits up to `INGEST_OUTCOME_WAIT_MS` for it and returns `indexStatus` (`indexed` | `pending` | `failed` | `not_indexed`) plus `indexError`. A host whose `ingest()` still resolves `undefined` (plain JS, or a cast past the type) has every successful index reported as `failed` with "the index run reported no reason" — and the tool tells the model to pass that on — so update the bridge before upgrading.
