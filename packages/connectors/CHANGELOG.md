## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 355994d: Side failures are now visible instead of silent (#420).
  
  - **New `warning` event** (`WarningEventData`, `WarningTask`): a side task — the conversation title, the post-turn result summaries, `compactIntent`'s rewrite, the retriever's query rewrite, `withReferences`' selection — failed and the turn ran on a fallback. It is always committed, rendered metadata-only into LLM-facing serializations, and is never read by `settleTurn`, `runChain`'s stop rule or `EventView.hasErrors()`, so a side failure cannot fail a turn or make the synthesizer apologise. `compactIntent`, the retriever's rewrite and `withReferences`' selector emit it where they used to emit an `error` (the selector's carried `kind: 'llm_call'`; the call record now rides the warning). **Breaking for exhaustive consumers**: `EventType` gains `'warning'`, so a `Record<EventType, …>` or an exhaustive `switch` over it stops compiling until it handles the new member.
  - **`withReferences`**: a selector that throws no longer skips the wrapped pattern; it runs with nothing attached, as `DEFAULT_ERROR_SEVERITY` already described.
  - **`compactBulkData`**: a batch that throws falls back per item (it used to skip the fallback), and a describe failure that leaves a result unsummarized records one `warning` per turn. **Breaking for describe implementations that relied on it**: the `DescribeFn` / `DescribeBatchFn` seam now treats a throw as the failure signal. `describeToolResultOp` and `describeToolResultsBatchOp` (`@hames-ai/harness-baml`) now **throw** on a failed call instead of returning `''` / an empty map.
  - **`runFirstTurnTitleGen`** (`@hames-ai/agents`) now **rejects** when the generation failed, instead of returning the same `null` as "nothing to name". `runRegenerateTitle` keeps its null-on-failure contract. `warningBubble` joins `errorBubble` in `replay`.
  - **Data Stash**: a failed ingest records its reason on the document as `ingestError` (cleared by the next run), and `IngestStatus` gains `'not_indexed'` for a copy stored in a format with no text to index. **Breaking for `GraphStashBridge` hosts** (`@hames-ai/connectors`): `ingest()` now resolves with how the run ended (`GraphStashIngestOutcome`), and `graph_file_ingest` waits up to `INGEST_OUTCOME_WAIT_MS` for it and returns `indexStatus` (`indexed` | `pending` | `failed` | `not_indexed`) plus `indexError`. A host whose `ingest()` still resolves `undefined` (plain JS, or a cast past the type) has every successful index reported as `failed` with "the index run reported no reason" — and the tool tells the model to pass that on — so update the bridge before upgrading.

### Patch Changes

- 2bb03a4: Agents are read-only against Neo4j (#403).
  
  `@hames-ai/harness-patterns`: `listTools()` no longer returns `write_neo4j_cypher`, including under a gateway prefix (`mcp__<server>__write_neo4j_cypher`) or a server namespace prefix (`<namespace>-write_neo4j_cypher`). `Tools()` and the BAML adapters' catalogs read through it. And `simpleLoop` and `actorCritic` refuse the tool in their allowlist check even when the allowlist you pass names it, or `dynamicToolAllowlist` / `dynamicToolPattern` would admit it; the refusal says the tool is withheld from every agent. So no agent's tool list, loop allowlist or planner catalog holds it. Like the management-tool filter, it is unconditional, and `listTools()` logs one warning per process when the gateway lists the tool. `callTool()` is unchanged: the list decides what an agent may call, not what the host may call by name. If an agent of yours wrote to Neo4j through this tool, it no longer can.
  
  `simpleLoop` now filters `fewShots` by the loop's allowlist before the controller sees them (#401): a shot whose `tool` the loop would refuse is dropped, and shots of `Return` and `expandPreviousResult` always stay. A model that copied a shot of a tool outside the allowlist used to end the loop on "Tool not allowed".
  
  `@hames-ai/agents`: new export `NEO4J_READ_ONLY_CONTEXT`, the controller context `search`, `retriever` and `general` now pass to the loops that reach Neo4j. It tells the controller the graph is read-only and to answer a request to change it instead of attempting one. `NEO4J_FEW_SHOTS_DEFAULT` is unchanged; its write example now reaches only a loop whose allowlist holds the write tool.
